# Advent of Code 2016

## Day 1: [No Time for a Taxicab](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/1)
Simple rotation and moving implementation.\
Good to recall the rotation formula; 
when you rotate left: `dx, dy = dy, -dx`
and when you rotate right: `dx, dy = -dy, dx`
### Bugs and issues:
* The only tricky point in this puzzle was to consider all the positions on the way of each step in the visited positions and not only the final position (for part 2)

## Day 2: [Bathroom Security](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/2)

Warming up on:

* reading input files
