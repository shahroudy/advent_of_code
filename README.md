### My solutions to the puzzles in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

At this moment the solutions are only in Python, but in near future I may try other languages as well.

## Python
To be able to run the scripts, you may need to install the provided code as a package:

```
cd Advent-Of-Code/python
python3 -m pip install -e .
```
Then you need to `cd` to each folder and run the scripts from there, e.g.
```
cd aoc2020/day01
python3 d01.py
```
